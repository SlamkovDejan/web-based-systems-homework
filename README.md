## Web Based Systems
### Homework solutions

This repository holds the code associated with the homework exercises for the course 'Web Based Systems' at FCSE - Skopje (2020/21).
You can find the requirements & solutions of each homework in the `raw-files/` folder (mk).

The 'Web Based Systems' course covers topics about the semantic web (RDF, OWL, SPARQL), linked data and data science over linked data.
The homework is meant to help us gain some hands on experience with most of the concepts we work through in theory.
